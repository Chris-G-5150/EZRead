# EZ Read is a Chrome extension for those with reading difficulties such as Dyslexia. It was designed in order to make the web more accessible for people with reading difficulties. 

# Research was conducted to find the most readable type-face as well as colour combinations for text and background. 

# I used several sources to confirm my findings the most valuable were located: 

# https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2012/text-customization/r11, 

# https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/73916/what-is-the-most-dyslexia-friendly-colour-combination  

# https://www.ayoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Creating-dyslexia-friendly-content.pdf

# Work will continue on this extension to add further functionality such as type-face choices as well as an upgraded user interface to make the extension more user-friendly.

# This is my first Chrome extension, currently at v1 as of 11/06/2023
